    <h1>Project 1: Make a Rainbow Card Game (Two-player Game)</h1>

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>For the two-player game, the cards are shuffled and each person gets half of the deck.</li>
        <li>Players take turns drawing a card and seeing if it's the next rainbow color they need.</li>
        <li>PHASE 2: If yes, they get a second draw.</li>
        <li>If it's not the next card they need, they put the card on the bottom of the deck.</li>
        <li>The first player to build a rainbow wins.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    
    <h3>Game outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The winner is <?php echo $winner ?></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
