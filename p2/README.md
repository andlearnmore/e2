## Notes for instructor
+ After completing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, I had some time and wanted to experiment with using a form to select a game from a few options.
+ I added the coin toss game (even though that isn't one of the game options for the project) as one I could code easily so that I could focus on how to use several forms. I hope that's ok!
