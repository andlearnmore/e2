    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In this game, players try to build a rainbow out of a deck of rainbow cards.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Solo game</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For my first pass, I'm going to do a solo game.</li>
        <li>The cards are shuffled and the player is dealt cards one by one.</li>
        <li>If a card is red, the player keeps it and starts to look for an orange card (and on through the rainbow).</li>
        <li>If the card is not red, the player discards it and draws the next card.</li>
        <li>In the solo game, I'm testing if the player can lose by not building a rainbow before getting through the deck.</li>
        <li>I'm going to have a counter for how many draws it took to win.</li>
        <li>I'd also like to do a test with 100 plays and see the average number of draws it takes.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Two-player game</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For the two-player game, the cards are shuffled and each person gets half of the deck.</li>
        <li>Players take turns drawing a card and seeing if it's the next rainbow color they need.</li>
        <li>PHASE 2: If yes, they get a second draw.</li>
        <li>If it's not the next card they need, they put the card on the bottom of the deck.</li>
        <li>The first player to build a rainbow wins.</li>
      </ul>
